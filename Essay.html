    Mathematics have been important to humans since its discovery. Eventually,
    mankind needed a way to do math quickly and efficiently without writing everything
    out by hand. These became the earliest calculators. These included the Abacus, Pascaline, and the ANITA calculator.

    The abacus was one of the earliest forms of the calculator. Earliest versions
    of the device can be found in early 300 BC. The abacus does not perform calculations itself,
    it is just a tool used to keep track of someone’s calculations.
    It is a simple construct. Usually made of wood, however, Romans made it out of metal, and modern
    ones are usually made of plastics. Abaci have a few rods stretching from one side to the next.
    Each rod has sliding beads on it. Each rod represents a power of ten. The rows go from one, ten,
    100, etc. These were very handy in the early days because it helped shopkeepers keep track of a
    customer’s total and change. It was an important step toward modern calculators as it showed
    inventors how important and useful a tool to calculate was.

    The next form of calculator was called the Pascaline. This machine was invented by Blaise
    Pascal. Pascal was a french mathematician and philosopher. He invented the machine between
    1642 and 1644. It was limited to addition and subtraction. It used dials to input numbers.
    Pascal invented it to help his father. His father was a tax collector. This makes the pascaline
    the first mechanical business calculator. Pascal built 50 pascalines in the 10 years after
    inventing them. Despite being so limited, with only addition and subtraction available,
    the pascaline was a huge step forward when it came to calculators. If a machine could add
    and subtract, surely one could multiply and divide.

    The ANITA calculator was the first all electronic, desktop calculator. They originally sold for
    what would now be around 8000 dollars. It was invented in 1962. Mk. 7 was sold in continental
    europe. The mk. 8 was sold in Britain and the remainder of the world. Eventually, the Mk. 8
    would become the only production model. The calculator was capable of addition, subtraction,
    division, and multiplication. The ANITA calculator was important in technology because it made
    big strides toward a much more manageable calculator that not only could do more, but was also
    easier to carry around. All these calculators were very important to the advancement of mathematics,
     and their importance shows the evolution of calculating technology throughout centuries.
